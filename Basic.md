# Welcome to the new Basic configuration mode

### What's changed?

- You can now drag and drop a save file into the file dropper to load in the data
- Cards and Relics can be added to your save file by clicking them in the selectors on the right side of the screen
- Cards and Relics can be removed from your save file by clicking them in the selectors on the left side of the screen
- You can update your current hp, max hp, gold, and hand size via the text fields
- The new editor does not yet support upgraded cards and will only deliver the basic versions.  Support for upgraded cards will be coming soon!
- This section of the page works, but still has a few weird bugs that need ironed out.  If you find anything that needs fixed, please report it [here](https://github.com/zuelong/save-the-spire) under the issues tab!

With any luck I'll get another update out this weekend that will squash some bugs and add support for upgraded cards!

Thank you all for your support and stay safe in the spire!
